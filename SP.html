<h2>Cyber Security</h2>
<p>
    Cyber Security is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from theft, damage, unauthorizedaccess, and other cyber threats. It encompess a wide range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard digital information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. In our project we use a machine learning algorithim to detect any netwrok intrusion with data provided from an outside source using this algorithim we can determine if a system has reliable network security.

<h4>Malware</h4>
<p>
    Malware which is short for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to harm, exploit, or compromise the functionality of a computer, network, or device. Malware can take various forms, each with its own set of malicious objectives. There are many types of malware in our project we touch upon ransomware which is a type of malware that encrypts a user's files or entire system in some cases and causing them to lose access to said systems and demanding a ransom in return of controll of the systems or files.
